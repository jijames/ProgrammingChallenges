## 001 Github Intro
This challenge is to get you familiar with ```git``` and ```Github```. Github and
similar code-sharing websites are a little like social networks for programmers.
People share code and other resources that you can access and potentially use in
your own programs.

Code and idea sharing makes programming much faster for everyone. It lets you focus
on your core problem instead of re-inventing what other people have already done.

### Resources
* [Create a Github account](https://github.com/join)
* [How to use Github](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
* [Github Desktop for Windows](https://desktop.github.com/)
* [Installing Git for Linux or OSx](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03)

## Challenge
1. Create a Github account (if you don't have one yet)
2. Use the Github web interface to create a repository (with a README file)
3. Use the Github web interface to create a branch
4. Use the Github web interface to add files to the branch
5. Use the Github web interface to merge the branch with master
6. Install git or Github Desktop on your local computer
7. Add a file to your repository on your local computer
8. Commit and push your local changes to your remote repository

### Expected Results
* A Github account
* One repository with at least one branch
* git software on your local computer
* A local copy of your repository connected to the remote copy
