## Programming Challenges
This repo contains a collection of programming-related challenges.
Working through these challenges will help you learn different
programming concepts. Plus, they are just fun!

### How it works
We will post a folder containing a README.md file. That file will
contain the challenge description, as well as additional information
useful for solving the challenge.

The directory will also contain a file called 'solution'. This file contains
the solution that we have found. You can run the solution file to
see how the correct output should look. You can also look at
the solution code to get hints when you are stuck.

#### Submit an answer
If you want me to review your solution to a particular problem, create
a *pull request* in Github with *only* your solution file. I will use
Github to give you feedback.

### Challenge Types
There are two basic types of challenges: programming and support.
Programming *(P)* challenges are problems that you need to write a program to solve.
Support *(S)* challenges are programming-related tasks that are not programming,
but that will assist in programming. For example, the first challenge in this series
is about using Github as a programming tool. See the (challenge template)[https://github.com/jijames/ProgrammingChallenges/blob/master/999-S-Template/README.md] for more information.

### Programming Languages
The great thing about programming is that there are many different ways to solve
the same problem. You can complete programming challenges in any language that you
choose.

For each challenge, I will recommend a set-up, depending on your platform (Windows/Linux).
My solution to the problem will be in the recommended languages.

When you get comfortable with programming, feel free to go back and try other languages
to solve the same problem. Understanding the differences in languages can help you choose
the best language to solve whatever issue you are working on. 

### Contributing
Do you have some programming challenges, or solutions in different languages that you would
like to submit to the collection? We welcome them! Please use an existing challenge as a
template, and submit a pull request with your updated challenge. See the (challenge template)[https://github.com/jijames/ProgrammingChallenges/blob/master/999-S-Template/README.md] to get started.
